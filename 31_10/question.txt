1. Seq with a stride of 8. Ex: 00 08 00 08
2. Seq which uses all mem caches in order, then loops. EX: 88 80 78 70 68 ... 10 08 00 -> 88 80 78 70 68 ...
3. 1ns is hit avg
4. 3ns is miss avg
5. 524288 because that is the highest array size until the read-writes no longer increase and are sent to L2.
6. 128 because that is the stride at which read-writes begin to flattin out.
7. 1ns
8. 4ns
9. 524288 because that is the highest array size until the read-writes no longer increase and are sent to L2.
10.128 because that is the stride at which read-writes begin to flattin out.
